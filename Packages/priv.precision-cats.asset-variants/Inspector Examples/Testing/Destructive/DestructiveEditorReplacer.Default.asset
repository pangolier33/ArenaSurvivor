  notes: 'This is an editor replacer that absolutely obliterates everything Editor
    Replacement has set up in the EditorTreeDef before it runs. It can demonstrate
    how the sequence (determined by priority) can affect the results of what shows
    up in the inspector window.

    If it''s active, it will turn the inspector
    into the most generic Editor it can.'
