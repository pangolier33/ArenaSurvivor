  notes: 'This is an editor replacer devoid of any functionality, used only for testing
    that the behaviour of the inspector remains the same whether a WrapperEditor
    is used or not.


    That is done by deactivating the other editor replacers,
    and activating this one, then using:

    Window/Asset Variants/[Enable/Disable]
    Editor Replacement

    to switch back and forth and see if there are differences,
    if a problem shows up due to Editor Replacement.'
