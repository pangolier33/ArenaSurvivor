  text: 'This is to demonstrate that when 2 assets have an array in common with very
    few elements that share the same value, then when you set the parent of one to
    the other, each differing element will get their own override automatically created.


    The
    shared value can also be the array size.

    Note the setting skipArrayDotArraySubProperty
    if you want to be able to override all elements with a single override, but not
    override the array size.


    It might be best to manually create an override
    for the array as a whole in such a case as this.'
