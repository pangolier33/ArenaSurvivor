2.0.0 - Improvements and Simplification

Upgrade Steps:
- If you previously modified your PDRSettings, make note of it. You can delete it.
- Delete the old package.
- Import the new package.
- Assign your settings asset/s if you previously created any to Window/Asset Variants in the tabs ERSettings/AVSettings.
- Possibly use the Setup options in Window/Asset Variants/Setup.

Additions:
- Inline Raw View button, which saves space.
- The Raw View button is now drawn as a dark/light toggle button.
- NonExtendedScriptableObjectAttribute to disable ExtendedScriptableObjectDrawer for specific fields.
- Assets/Asset Variants/Select All.
- PDRSettings.considerWholeAllInvisibleChildren and PDRSettings.considerSeparate.
- TooltipIcon.
- Unification of settings into the new Window/Asset Variants window.
- Help tab in the System Prefs window.
- Various additions.

Fixes:
- EditorTool and EditorToolContext are now blacklisted from Editor Replacement.
- OnSceneGUI works again when WrapperEditors are used.
- Fixed InvalidOperationException bug.
- Fixed "... _unity_self" error bug.
- Fixed a horizontal scrollbar showing up bug.
- Various fixes.

Removals:
- Removed property-drawer-replacement, replaced by the new PropertyModifier.
- Removed Asset Variants' dependency on editor-replacement.
- Button style no longer exists for non-Raw View IMGUI.
- AVUtility.OnValuesChanged() is now gone. No need to call it when fields are modified by code.
- Rainbow.

Changes:
- "Unwrapped fields" are far less common (this especially affects built in asset types. This change does not affect Materials' unwrapped fields).
- Parent field etc. are now drawn in the header.
- Implicit overrides are now created whenever a field is modified (such as by user code) on any compatible asset. (This change can also affect performance as any change will require a full object comparison, eventually).
- Raw View is now a popup window, exclusive to Asset Variants/.
- What remains of PDRSettings has moved to AVSettings.
- The considerWhole arrays are now grouped into a class.
- Settings are now stored by GUID not path. (If you created your own settings assets you will need to reassign them to be current again).
- Editor replacement initialization now happens immediately after a recompilation, instead of a frame later, making use of the new InitializeBeforeEditorReplacementAttribute.
- ExtendedScriptableObjectDrawer now supports nested drawing.
- Much less intrusive insertion of functionality into UI Toolkit especially.
- Dropped support for Unity versions before 2020.2, for lack of required APIs.
- Many small changes.




1.2.2 - Fixes

Fixes:
- Fix to WrapperEditor's preview drawing. This fixes multi-selection errors namely for ParticleSystem when a component-compatible editor replacer is enabled.
- WrapperEditors are now appropriately collapsible (e.g. a Renderer's Material at the bottom of a GameObject inspector).
- typeof(ParticleSystem) is added to onlyIMGUITargetTypes, because UIElements' IMGUIContainer breaks its layouting.
- Fixed WrapperEditor misalignments particularly to do with BeginFoldoutHeaderGroup.
- Removed editorIMGUIContainerHierarchyMode as it doesn't do anything anymore.
- The order of ~"Apply to Ancestor"s is flipped now to match Unity's order for ~"Apply to Prefab"s.

Changes:
- ColorWrapEditorReplacer is now a RemapFilteredEditorReplacer.
- typeof(ParticleSystem) is added to ColorWrapEditorReplacer's (new) blacklist for cosmetic reasons.
- Project settings types are now blacklisted for AVEditor, because there's not really a reason it should use it. They are also blacklisted for color wraps, because of cosmetic reasons.
- Animator Controller is now blacklisted for AVEditor, because it has no serialized properties, so there is nothing Asset Variants can do with it.



1.2.1 - Patch

Changes:
- Descendants are now cached.
- m_Script is now blacklisted.

Fixes:
- Fixed DrawHeader bug that broke Addressables.
- Context menu now immediately propagates.



1.2.0 - Return to Familiarity

Upgrade steps:
- Delete EditorContainer.cs, import the new package, then recompile/restart.

Additions:
- Added the Thin Bars style option.
- Added the option for bolding overridden fields.
- UIElements' composite fields now have override buttons/thin bars (and bolding) for its children fields. This is possible because:
- PropertyDrawer Replacement can now ApplyStyling.
- Added "Create Override", "Create Override Keep Children", "Remove Children Overrides", "Remove Override", and "Clean Up Overrides" to the context menu.
- Applying to any specific ancestor is now possible when single selection.
- Added an "Edit in Raw View" context menu item to open the property in a Raw View popup window, further facilitating the hiding of the raw view button.
- AVSettings, ERSettings, and PDRSettings assets now each have a TypeFilter field, so that writing code is not required to blacklist or whitelist types.
- Added various new settings.
- Sub-assets editor replacer with a single target now draws without a target foldout.
- "Assets/Validate All Asset Variants" menu item.
- When a child asset is open in another Editor, changes will be propagated to it immediately.

Changes:
- Editor Replacement now uses InspectorElement, which supports GenericInspector, which can improve performance, features, and familiarity over UIElements as default. Prefab override bars are also supported in UIElements now.
- Some better MenuItem priorities.
- Raw view now always applies default margins.

Fixes:
- "Revert" and "Apply to Parent" context menu items no longer show up if there are no relevant overrides.
- Blacklist and whitelist are now searched by nearest BaseType match.
- Fixed FormerlySerializedAsAttribute override renaming to account for sub-overrides.
- Fixed some alignment bugs.
- Odin editor implicit override creation works better for "unwrapped" fields.
- In UIElements long and short fields can now create implicit overrides.
- Context menu now works for Raw View foldouts.
- Optimization for deeply nested fields.
- Cyclical ManagedReference graphs no longer cause freezes.
- Root level IMGUI foldout triangles with UIElements color wraps active are now clickable. 
- Better comparison in CreateOverridesFromDifferences.
- Color wrap margins are now consistent in IMGUI.
- Color wraps' heights in IMGUI are now immediately correct.
- Context menu no longer throws errors if an asset is null due to missing script.
- Editor Replacement now uses CreateEditorWithContext.
- Bounds/BoundsInt now have a RawPropertyResolver so they draw children override buttons/bars in Odin.
- RawViewWrapperEditor no longer draws spacing if there is no Raw View button drawn.
- Odin example scripts compile for build now.




1.1.0 - UX Improvements

Upgrade steps:
- Delete the old package.
- Import the new package.
- Use the menu Window/Asset Variants/... for some quick setup options.
- If desired, use the new Window/System Prefs window.

Additions:

- Added 5 new color wraps presets, including a grayscale one.
- Added color wrap preset duplication.
- Added whitelisting settings for combinations of Material only and Scriptable Object only.
- Added new settings.
- Added some context menu items.
- Overrides created in CreateOverridesFromDifferences are now logged to the console.
- Added Window/System Prefs to manage SystemPrefs's active and priority values.

Changes:
- Improved type blacklisting, to use the new TypeFilter which includes whitelist and inheritedWhitelist.
- Better margins.
- The setting formerlySerializedAsBaseAssetTypes no longer uses AssemblyQualifiedName.
Color wraps now use sub-assets instead of folders.
- Completely revamped PrefsPriority to become SystemPrefs, with all-around improved user experience.

Fixes:
- Miscellaneous fixes for when UIElements draws IMGUI.
- Component Raw View works now for UIElements.
- Fixes to AVTargets persistence.
- The setting disableMaterialVariants now works.
